# QuickPythonJupyterSetUp

Alright if you already know which python package you need copy paste them in requirements.txt then run:

    source ./venv.sh

this should create venv environnement and download the package as well as already putting you in a venv environment


if not, you can:

    enter the venv environnement by typing:  source /myenv/bin/activate
  
    exit the venv environement by typing: deactivate
  
    Download the package in requirements.txt again by running when in venv environment: pip3 install -r requirements.txt



Once this is down, you can start a jupyter lab by running.

    bash jupiterInstall.sh

enter the password you wish

the default address and port are the loopback address 127.0.0.1 and port 8888
but it should open automatically at the end of the installation.


enjoy.
kind regard,
a lazy ass
